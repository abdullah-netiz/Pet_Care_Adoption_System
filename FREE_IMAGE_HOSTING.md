## Option 5: Use Existing Pet Images Online
You can also use sample images from free stock photo sites:
- https://unsplash.com (search "dog" or "cat")
- https://pexels.com
- https://pixabay.com

Right-click any image → "Copy image address" → Paste in form

## Tips:
✅ Always use **direct image links** (ends with .jpg, .png, .jpeg)
✅ Make sure the image is publicly accessible
✅ Test the URL by pasting it in a new browser tab - should show just the image
❌ Don't use links that open image in a viewer/page
